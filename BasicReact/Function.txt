Difference between functions and method
1.A function is a  block of code designed to perform a specific task.
2.Functions can be called independently, and they donâ€™t need to be associated with any particular object.

1.A method is essentially a function that is defined within object.
2.Methods cannot be called independently , they required any object or classes


why do we need arrow function 
It increase the feability and readibility of code
-> It is easier to understand

They take a component as a input and return a new componet and they return componrt with the name of Componet 

*** callback function vo hote h jinhe hum kise function m passs krte h 
*** High order function vo hote h jin function m hum ye pass krte h 

{function a(b){
    // console.log("aditi")
    b();  //a will become a high order function because is the argument we are getting b
    console.log(b())
}

function sayHi(){
    let a = 23;
    let b = 5;
    console.log("Hy aditi j")
    return a+b
}
sayHi.age = 98
//sayHi().age   //idar value assigned ni hogi vo error dega
// console.log(sayHi)  value will be assigned here
const x = sayHi
console.log(x.age)
a(x)}

A callback function in JavaScript is a function that is passed into another function as an argument and is executed (or "called back") at a later time

In how many types we can declare the functions ->
//function declaration ->
function square(){
    return 3*3
}

//function expression ->
const square = function(){
    return 3*3
}

//arrow function declaration
const square = () =>{
    return 3*3
}
or
const square = () => 3*3     //explicity return kr deta h humne return keyword ka use ni krna pdta h
